    "\n",
    "In this section, your goal is to answer questions in the following format:\n",
    "```\n",
    "What is a synonym for warrior?\n",
    "a) soldier\n",
    "b) sailor\n",
    "c) pirate\n",
    "d) spy\n",
    "```\n",
    "You are given a word and a list of candidate choices as input. Your objective is to return the choice that you believe is the synonym. To accomplish this, you'll first implement two similarity metrics: Euclidean distance and cosine similarity. Then, you'll use these metrics to answer the multiple-choice questions.\n",
    "Specifically, you will implement the following three functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `euclidean_distance()`: Calculate the Euclidean distance between two vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `cosine_similarity()`: Calculate the cosine similarity between two vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `find_synonym()`: Given a word, a list of four candidate choices, and a specified similarity metric, return the word that you think is the synonym. The function takes comparison_metric as a parameter: if its value is euc_dist, you'll use Euclidean distance as the similarity metric; if its value is cosine_sim, you'll use cosine similarity as the metric."

    "  1. he later learned that the incident was caused by the concorde's sonic boom\n",
    "  2. he later found out the alarming incident had been caused by concorde's powerful sonic boom\n",

    "Take in 2 sentences as input, and output either true or false. To do this, create a sentence embedding that represents each sentence in vector form, then apply cosine similarity to compute the similarity between the two sentence embeddings. If they have a high enough similarity, output \"True\" and otherwise \"False\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, first turn each sentence into a single vector embedding. There are a few different this can be done and for this assignment, we will consider two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple sum**: Sum the word embeddings of each individual word in the sentence. This resulting vector is the sentence embedding vector.\n",
    "1. **Sum with POS weighting**: Take a weighted sum of the individual word vectors, where the weighting depends on the part of speech (POS) of that given word. Each POS (verb, noun, adjective, etc) has a different scalar weight associated with it. We multiply each word vector by the scalar weight associated with its part of speech, then sum these weighted vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the following 2 functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `get_embedding()`: given a sentence (string), return the sentence embedding (vector). The function also takes in the parameter `use_POS`:\n",
    "if `use_POS` is false (regular case), use sum of the word embeddings for each word in the sentence (ignoring words that do not appear in our vocabulary).\n",
    "if use_POS is true, use a weighted sum, where each word is weighted by a scalar that depends on its part of speech tag.\n",
    "1. `get_similarity()`: given two sentences, find the cosine similarity between their corresponding sentence embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helpful hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve given you a map `POS_weights` that maps part of speech tags to their associated weight. For example, `POS_weights['NN'] = 0.8` (where NN is the POS tag for noun).\n",
    "\n",
    "**You should skip words that are not in the embeddings or have a POS tag that is not in POS_weights.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a list of all the words in the sentence, use nltk's word_tokenize function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> sentence = \"this is a sentence\"\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the POS tags for each word in a sentence, you can use `nltk.pos_tag`. To use it, you provide a list of words in a sentence, and it returns a list of tuples, where the first element is the word and the second is its corresponding POS tag. \n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that you pass in the entire sentence to a single call to `nltk.pos_tag`; do not call `nltk.pos_tag` separately on each word in the sentence. This is because some words can be multiple parts of speech (for example, \"back\" can be a noun or a verb). Passing in the entire sentence allows for more context to figure out what POS tag a word should have.\n",
